# asteroids_race
 simple pygame asteroid race
 as much procedural as possible instead than class based because 1st year students are not into OO yet


# TODO
- collisions
- fix WARING position (currently it goes offscreen)
- respawn ship
- add ship animation and effects
- save highscore
- display some kind of menu
- game start countdown
- better score sistem, maybe add more points by flying close to asteroids
- sound effects
- extra: shield system that depletes on collision and recharges overtime
- extra: bonuses
- additional controls (touch, mouse, joystick, controller)
- resize screen and/or scale game depending on client screen height
- better ships
